Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari emphasized that the AI revolution should not be a competition between good and evil, advocating for global cooperation to ensure safety and suggesting the creation of an international body to provide information.\n\n- How can we ensure the development of sovereign AI is transparent and involves public participation?\n- The rapid growth of U.S. social media has negatively impacted democracy.\n- There is a need to establish an international institution to share AI safety information.\n- Create an international body without regulatory power to provide AI information.\n\nRef. 「[Harari x Audrey 2021](https://ynews.page.link/wv6J)」","name":"Prof. Yuval Noah Harari x Legislator KO Ju-Chun on
